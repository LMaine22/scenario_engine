Coverage by Regime (Conformal):

============================================================
METHODOLOGY:
- Split conformal prediction with proper time-series handling
- Train: 2010-2018, Calibration: 2019-2021, Test: 2022-2025
- Mondrian stratification by volatility regime
- NO manual inflation factors - coverage achieved via residual quantiles
- Guarantees marginal coverage without distributional assumptions
