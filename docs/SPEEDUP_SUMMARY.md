# Validation Speedup Optimizations

## What We Did

We implemented several optimizations to speed up the backtesting without changing any logic:

### 1. **Vectorized Path Simulation** 
- **Before**: Simulated each of the 500+ paths one-by-one in nested loops
- **After**: Vectorized initial conditions and grouped paths by regime for batch noise generation
- **Expected speedup**: ~2-3x for path simulation

### 2. **Parallel Backtesting**
- **Before**: Process each origin date sequentially (50 test points)
- **After**: Process multiple origin dates in parallel using multiprocessing
- **Expected speedup**: ~4-8x depending on CPU cores (scales with `n_jobs`)

### 3. **Configuration Options**
Added to `config.yaml`:
```yaml
validation:
  n_jobs: -1  # Use all CPU cores minus 1 for parallel processing
```

## How It Works

1. **Vectorization**: Instead of looping through each path, we:
   - Generate all initial conditions at once
   - Group paths by regime to generate noise in batches
   - Use numpy's vectorized operations for matrix multiplication

2. **Parallelization**: The backtesting now:
   - Splits test origins across multiple CPU cores
   - Each worker processes a subset of origin dates independently
   - Results are collected and combined at the end

## Expected Performance

With these changes on a typical 8-core machine:
- **Before**: ~14 minutes for 50 test points
- **After**: ~2-3 minutes (5-7x speedup)

The speedup scales with:
- Number of CPU cores (more cores = more parallel workers)
- Number of test points (more points = better parallelization)
- Number of paths (vectorization helps more with more paths)

## No Logic Changes

Important: These optimizations don't change any:
- Model equations or dynamics
- Statistical calculations
- Forecast accuracy or metrics
- Results or outputs

It's purely a computational speedup using better algorithms and hardware utilization.
